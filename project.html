<h2>Final Project</h2>

	<p>In the final project for this course, you will apply the
	  techniques learned in this class to analyze a
	  data set of personal interest to you. Your goal should be to
	  create an original project that you would be proud to
	  show off to a potential employer. You are encouraged to
	  upload your project to Github after the course is over.
	</p>

	  
	<h3>Requirements</h3>

	<p>The outline below is only a suggestion. If you have a
	  completely different idea for a data science project
	  that does not fit neatly with the following requirements,
	  please come talk to me.</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>The data that you analyze should be complex to
	    collect or to clean in some way.</li>
	  <li>You should create informative visualizations to
	    explain the data and your findings.</li>
	  <li>You should use machine learning to build a model to
	    predict some outcome variable in your data set.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You are expected to work on this project in pairs, although
	you can work individually if you prefer. Please note that if
	  you work alone, you are still expected to produce the
	same amount of work as a two-person team.</p>

	
	<h3>Deliverables</h3>

	<ul>
	  <li>Create a directory containing the following notebooks:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Data Collection and Cleaning: This notebook should
		contain all code that you
		wrote to collect and clean the data.</li>
	      <li>Data Exploration: This notebook should contain all
		code that you wrote as you were exploring the data.
		It should contain results and visualizations.</li>
	      <li>Machine Learning: This notebook should contain the
		code that you wrote to determine what model to fit and
		to analyze the performance of the model you ultimately
		chose.</li>
	      <li>Presentation: This is a notebook containing just
		the highlights from your analyses above. It should not
		contain much code, unless the code is important for
		understanding the analysis. You will be presenting
		from this notebook during the in-class presentation
		session. (Note: If you prefer to present from slides,
		you may submit the slides instead of a
		notebook.)</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Submit this directory in
	    one of two ways:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Upload the project to Github. (Make sure the
		repository is public.) Provide the link to this Github
		repository on Canvas.
	      </li>
	      <li>Create a .zip file out of the directory. Upload this
		.zip file to Canvas.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    In general, I will <i>not</i> be re-running your notebooks
	    unless I am confused about something, so it is not
	    necessary to include data files in you submission.
	    However, if the data files are small and it is convenient
	    to include them, please do so.
	  </li>
	  <li>Present your work at a 3-hour poster session.</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>

	<p>You will be graded on a 0-4 scale in each of the categories
	  below. A 0 means that the component is missing from the
	  project altogether, while the meanings of scores of 1-4 
	  are summarized below. In general, you get a 3 for meeting
	  expectations and doing solid work; to earn a 4, you have
	  to go above and beyond in some way.</p>

	<h3>Where to Find Datasets</h3>

	<p>The best data set is one that you are passionate about. I
	  recommend that you start by finding a question you want to
	  answer and then finding data to answer that question, rather
	  than starting with a data set. That said, here are some
	  helpful websites with large collections of data.</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch">Google
	  Data Set Search</a></li>
	  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/">Reddit
	      Datasets</a></li>
	  <li><a href="https://www.data.gov/">U.S. Government's Open
	      Data</a></li>
	  <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle
	      Datasets</a></li>
