	<h3>Course Description</h3>

<p>This course is a practical overview of the field of data science. It is designed to
  equip you with the tools to begin extracting insight from your own data. We will
  manipulate and analyze data of different shapes and sizes (e.g., tabular,
  textual, hierarchical, geospatial). We will discuss common patterns and
  pitfalls of data analysis. We will train machine learning models, encountering
  the key ideas of machine learning along the way
  (e.g., supervised vs. unsupervised, regression vs. classification, training vs. testing,
  hyperparameter tuning, ensembles). This course focuses on intuition and implementation,
  rather than theory and math. This course culminates in a project where you apply the
  ideas from this class to a data science problem of your choosing.
	</p>

	<h3>Who Should Take This Class?</h3>
	
	<p><b>This course is designed for college freshmen and sophomores.</b></p>

	<ul>
	  <li>This is a hands-on class that will have you analyzing real data.
	    To do this, you need to know how to code (preferably in Python).
	    So CS 106a is a prerequisite. You don't need to be an experienced programmer;
	    if you know how to write a <code>for</code> loop and use a
	    <code>dict</code> in Python, you'll likely be fine.
	  </li>
	  <li>You need to be comfortable doing <i>basic</i> math. We'll be aggregating,
	    transforming, and comparing numbers every day in this class. But there will be
	    no calculus, no linear algebra. We will focus on the intuition
	    behind data science methods, rather than the math.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you have experience with data science and/or machine learning already, this is
	  probably not the class for you. You will likely pick up some useful skills, but you might
	  find the pace of the class slow.</p>


	<h3>Class Structure</h3>

	<p>There will be some kind of class every weekday:
	  <ul>
	    <li>On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we will meet as an entire class for lecture.
	      In lecture, the professor will introduce data science concepts, do some live coding, and
	      assign some exercises for you to try at home.
	    </li>
	    <li>On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you will meet with a TA in small sections. In section,
	      you will present and discuss solutions to the exercises posed in lecture the day before.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<p>Attendance is mandatory and counts towards your participation grade (see below).</p>
	

	<h3>Grading</h3>

	<ul>
	  <li>Weekly Labs: 15%</li>
	  <li>2 Exams: 35% (15% each, with 5% added to your higher exam)</li>
	  <li>Final Project: 40%</li>
	  <li>Participation: 10%</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>About the Participation Grade:</b> There are several ways
	  to earn this participation grade:
	  <ol>
	    <li>presenting your solutions in section</li>
	    <li>answering other students' questions on the class Discord</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
